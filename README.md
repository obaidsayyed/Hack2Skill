Student Opportunity Navigator

Student Opportunity Navigator is an AI-powered web platform designed to help students discover eligible scholarships and government exams through structured eligibility filtering and multilingual guideline simplification. Many students struggle to understand complex eligibility rules, navigate multiple government portals, and verify authentic registration links. This platform addresses that gap by providing a centralized, profile-based filtering system that presents only those opportunities a student truly qualifies for, eliminating confusion and reducing time spent manually reviewing lengthy guidelines.

The system works by allowing students to enter essential details such as age, education level, annual income, category, and state. These inputs are sent to a FastAPI backend that applies strict rule-based eligibility checks against structured opportunity data stored in Firebase Firestore. Each opportunity is evaluated based on defined criteria including age limits, education requirements, income thresholds for scholarships, category eligibility, state restrictions, and deadline validity. Only opportunities that satisfy all required conditions are displayed to the student. Eligibility is binary—either eligible or not eligible—ensuring clarity and accuracy without artificial scoring systems.

The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS to provide a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. The backend is developed with FastAPI in Python, which handles filtering logic, data retrieval, and integration with external services. Firebase Firestore serves as the database, storing structured scholarship and government exam records, including eligibility rules, registration links, deadlines, and verification status. Expired opportunities are automatically excluded from active listings to maintain reliability.

To improve accessibility, the platform integrates the Gemini API to simplify complex official guidelines and translate them into multiple languages based on user preference. This ensures that students from diverse linguistic backgrounds can clearly understand application procedures and requirements. If translation fails, the system safely falls back to the original content without disrupting user experience.

The MVP focuses on clean architecture, accurate filtering, multilingual accessibility, and verified opportunity presentation. It does not include user authentication, SMS or email notifications, automated government API scraping, or advanced ranking systems. The goal is to deliver a scalable and cost-efficient prototype that demonstrates real-world impact while remaining technically feasible within hackathon constraints. Student Opportunity Navigator aims to improve equitable access to academic and career opportunities by transforming scattered and complex information into structured, accessible, and personalized guidance for students across communities.
